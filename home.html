  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>
    Wen Lin Tang is located at Chung Chi College, The Chinese University of Hong
    Kong. Since 1972, it has been dedicated by the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui
    (Anglican Church). Originally a co-ed dormitory, it has now become a
    male-only residence. The hostel is situated along Tai Po Road and is the
    only CUHK dormitory located outside the main campus, right opposite to the
    Chung Chi Gate. Wen Lin Tang is a three-story building that provides 32
    rooms with a total of 54 bed spaces.
